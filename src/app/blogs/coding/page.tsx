            So it All started with the laptop that my father bought when i was
            in maybe 6th or 7th standard, and i was really excited to start
            using this , i remember there were no smart phone except my father
            at our home but then also i would use that laptop without the
            internet for most of the time of the day after coming from school,
            Oh I just forgot to tell you it was Chad Lenovo Thinkpad with
            Windows 7 with 1gb am with that small mouse or whatever it was
            between the keyboard, so the thing that i loved during those days
            was to fill the forms of the people on the laptop.

          <p className="mt-8 font-bold">2) My First Program in Python ?</p>
          <p className="mt-3 border-t border-b border-gray-300 px-3 py-2  ">
            Believe it or not that was the first Laptop in which i Installed
            python in 8th class and written a program in Python which was
            calculator, and not a simple calculator but the calculator with GUI
            made with Tkinter, like present in the Windows, but i just copied
            the whole app from a Youtube tutorial and i want you to know that I
            typed each and every line of that code , so at that time i was
            convinced that this calculator is entirely made by me infact I
            showed it to my father when he came back from college after teaching
            that look papa I made this and obviously i didn&apos;t tell him that
            i copied it From a youtube video, and another day i showed to my
            brothers and friends you know just show off things and that&apos;s
            the same thing i don&apos;t like today idk why, So this was my first
            Program
